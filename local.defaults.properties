# Default properties for CI/CD builds
# This file contains safe default values when local.properties is not present.
# The actual API key should be set in local.properties (not checked into version control).
#
# For local development:
#   1. Copy your API key to local.properties: MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_key
#
# For CI/CD:
#   1. Set MAPS_API_KEY environment variable, or
#   2. Use a CI-specific properties file

# Placeholder value - Maps features won't work with this but builds will succeed
MAPS_API_KEY=PLACEHOLDER_API_KEY_FOR_CI_BUILD
